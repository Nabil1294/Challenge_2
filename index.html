             <p class="general-info">
                I was born on December 1st, 1994, in Alexandria, Egypt.
                I attended Janaklees National Schools for my early education. 
                Later, I pursued my studies in the School of Business and graduated from the accounting and finance section with an excellent academic performance in May 2017.
                Following my graduation, I embarked on a rewarding professional journey, starting as a customer service and accounts manager at QNB Bank, where I honed my skills and gained valuable experience for two years.
                Seeking new horizons, I decided to move to the United States, where I explored various opportunities in different industries.

             <p class="abilities">
                Throughout my time in the United States,
                I embraced various roles and challenges across diverse job settings.
                However, my passion for continuous learning and personal growth motivated me to take a significant step in my career. 
                Determined to merge my interests in technology and business, I made the decision to return to studying. 
                This led me to embark on a remarkable journey at UNC Chapel Hill Coding Bootcamp. 
                Enrolling in the bootcamp provided me with an immersive and dynamic learning experience, equipping me with cutting-edge skills in web development and programming. 
                I am now eager to apply my expertise and enthusiasm in pursuing exciting opportunities in the tech industry, combining my accounting and finance background with my newly acquired coding skills.
