# Title
<Challenge-2_My-Resume_Web-Page>

## Description 
designed web page as to be representing my resume in a unique professional way to express myself to employers.
 That page shows a section about myself, all projects implemented by me and how should I be contacted. 
 It also represents 3 main sections and 2 titles. 
 In that web page it'll easily show all information needed for employers to find throughout the sections.
 Finally i learned how to use html5 and css in a challenging way and also a great way to practice skills I was taught and looked for in a web page that can hold much more and gets even bigger with more skills and information I'll catch along my journey in the coding bootcamp.
